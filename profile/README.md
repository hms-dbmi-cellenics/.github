# Cellenics

[Cellenics](https://scp.biomage.net/) is an open-source platform developed in part by Harvard's Department of Biomedical Informatics. Cellenics consists of multiple repositories - the codebase of the platform itself, as well as repositories that define the AWS infrastructure and provide various utilities.
